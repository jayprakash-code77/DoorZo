// const { Listing } = require("../middleware/isOwner"); : This Warning: """Accessing non-existent property 'Listing' of module exports inside circular dependency""". 
Solution :Warning means that there is a circular dependency in your code ‚Äî specifically, two or more modules are requiring each other in a way that forms a loop. And in this loop, one module is trying to access a property (Listing) before it's fully defined.

What is a Circular Dependency?
A circular dependency occurs when:
    Module A requires Module B
    And Module B requires Module A (either directly or indirectly)
    When Node.js encounters a circular dependency, it partially evaluates the module during the first require, which can lead to undefined properties.
